	# However, due to a bug in kern/tty_pty.c, we have to turn it on
	# first, then turn it off.  In fact, we have to turn it on then off
	# before telnetd gets time to read the pty.  The best we can hope for
	# is that this bug is only on slow hardware, like pandora.  Amusingly,
	# another bug, in stty, requires us to set another option before
	# extproc can be turned on.  Without all this dancing about, one end
	# can be in line mode, and the other not, causing extra echoing of
	# all commands and the total failure of character-at-a-time commands
